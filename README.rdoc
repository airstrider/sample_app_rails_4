# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I, Ryan Kim, will be completing this application in order to lear Ruby on Rails. I have already followed and built the same application with the tutorial without a series of testing process. From now on I will be applying the test driven development concept with this applcation. 

Studying the tutorial, I have been so interested in developing applications by using Ruby on Rails and would like to deeply thank Michael Hartle, the author of the tutorial, for his effort to share his knowledge and skill.

I have graduated with a MBA degree from the Krannert school of Management at Purdue University last May and am looking for a software developer position. Before my MBA era, I have worked as Sr. Java Developer and IT Project Manager for over 6 years in Seoul, Korea Republic since 2002. My short term goal is to be an excellent web application developer and my long term goal is to be a marketable middleman who can understands both the business and the technology and provides customers with optimal solutions for their business success.

To do so, I heartly realize that I must re-sharpen my software development skill set because it seems to become old-fashioned for over 2 years when I have been at School. Having interviews, I felt that my talents would not attract interests of the software development market any more in terms of my outdated skill and that I need to catch up with currently popular technology and trends for my career.

After completing this exercise, I will build my own application with Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, and PostgreDB. I have an idea that I have been thinking for a long time and I feel that this is the moment to act.

As I have done so far, I will try to do my best. If you are interested in me, please keep an eye on what I am doing. I will make it at the end.
